Welcome to the RAG Chatbot System

This is a sample document to demonstrate the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot system.

What is RAG?
RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It is a technique that combines information retrieval 
with text generation to create more accurate and contextual AI responses.

How does it work?
1. Documents are processed and split into smaller chunks
2. These chunks are converted into vector embeddings
3. When a user asks a question, relevant chunks are retrieved
4. The language model uses these chunks to generate an informed response

Benefits of RAG:
- Provides more accurate answers based on specific documents
- Reduces hallucination in AI responses
- Allows the AI to cite sources
- Can be updated with new information without retraining

Use Cases:
- Customer support with product documentation
- Internal knowledge bases
- Research assistants
- Educational tutoring systems

Technical Components:
- Document Processing: PyPDF and text loaders
- Vector Store: ChromaDB for efficient similarity search
- Embeddings: OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002
- LLM: GPT-3.5-turbo or GPT-4 for response generation
- Framework: LangChain for orchestration

This system allows you to build intelligent chatbots that can answer questions based on your own documents!
